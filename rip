#RIP Characteristics#
- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a Distance Vector routing protocol.
- It uses hop count as its metric
- The maximum hop coount is 15
- It will perform Equal Cost Multi path, for up to 4 paths by default
RIPv2 and RIPv1
RIPv1 is a legacy protocol which is not typically used anymore (although) it is still supported on Cisco routers)
RIPv1 does not send subnet mast information with routing updates so Variable Length Masking (VLSM) is not supported. RIv2 does support VLSM.
RIPv2 updates are send every 30 seconds as broadcast traffic. RIPv2 uses multicast address 244.0.0.9
RIPv2 supports authentication, RIPv1 does not.
RIPng
RIPng (RIP next generation) supports IPv6 networks.
It is not covered on the CCNA exam.
    
RIPv2 Configuration
    router rip
    version 2
    network 10.0.0.0
- The 'network' command should referance classful network. No subnet mask is specified.
Auto-Summary
- RIP will autometically summarise routes to the classful boundray by default
- For example, 192.168.10.1/30 will be advsertised as 192.168.10.0/24
- 172.16.10.1/30 will be advsertised as 172.16.0.0/16
- This is almost never desireable
    R1 (config) #router rip
    R1 (config-router) #no auto-summary
Manual summarisation
- Manual summarisation gives you control of exactly how you summarise
- The individual summarised routes are not advertised - only their summary route
    R2 (config-router) #interface fa0/1
    R2 (config-if) #ip summary-address rip 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0
